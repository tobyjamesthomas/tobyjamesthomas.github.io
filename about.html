  <h1>What's Human Startup?</h1>
  <p>
    Human Startup is a mindset that I've adopted over the years while working at numerous startups 👨‍💻. The idea is to be a ferocious learner 🐯, constantly iterating 🛠 and driven to innovate 💡. All the while, staying humble 🙇 and thinking about how I can positively impact people's lives ✨. That's what I really care about ❤️. Join me and live life like a startup! 🚀
